      //3. Surround steps 4-9 in a try-catch block that catches any IOExceptions.
    
    	 //4. Create an object of the Socket class. When initializing the object, pass in the ip address and the port number
 
         //5. Create a DataOutputStream object. When initializing it, use the Socket object you created in step 4 to call the getOutputStream() method.
         
         //6. Use the DataOutputStream object to send a message to the server using the writeUTF(String message) method
         
         //7. Create a DataInputStream object. When initializing it, use the Server object you created in step 4 to call the getInputStream() method.

         //9. Close the client's server object
